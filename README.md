# todo-review-procedural-oo

This is a simple a todo list application written procedurally, with ES6 Class syntax, and with pre-es6 Objects. To view the procedural approach, comment out in index.html

```
<script src="taskClass.js"></script>
<script src="taskList.js"></script>
<script src="ooApp.js"></script>
```
    
To see both versions of the OO approach, comment out either the Class keyword version or the pre-ES6 version
